# Hi 👋, I'm Suraj Gupta

I am a passionate **Python/Django Developer** with a growing interest in **Data Engineering**. With hands-on experience of more than 2 Years building scalable web applications and DRF using Django and Python, I am now expanding my skills to work with cloud-based data pipelines and big data tools (Pyspark, Data Bricks, Data Factory) on **Microsoft Azure**. I enjoy solving real-world problems with clean, efficient, and scalable code while continuously learning new technologies to stay updated in this fast-paced industry.
